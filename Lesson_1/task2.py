#Calculator on 1 line of code :3 P.s(it's not the one that was in the video in Flud, or rather, it's a little modified :3) 
print("rtkachuk welcome to my Calculator :3")
while True: print("Result: "+str(eval(input("Calculate: "))))
#P.S don't ban me, the light was turned off 5 times for the whole Week when I wanted to do something :(
